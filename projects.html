            <u>Personal Website - December 2023 - January 2024:</u> <br /> <br />
            My latest project is this website! I used vanilla HTML and CSS to create it,
            with Git/GitHub for version control. 
        </p>

        <p>
            <u>E-Commerce Website - August 2023 - December 2023:</u> <br /> <br />
            Collaborated with a team of three to build a rudimentary e-commerce website representing the sale of NHL Jerseys using <i>Angular</i> (HTML, CSS, TypeScript) 
            and <i>REST APIs (with Java Spring Boot/Embedded Tomacat Server)</i> alongside Git for version control and GitHub as a team repository.
            JUnit/Mockito was used for testing. Implemented (both frontend and backend): a functional search bar, sorting functionality, multi-panel product browsability, 
            add to cart functionality, user login, administrator login, customer checkout, and gift giving functionality. Guided with OpenUP and Agile-Scrum 
            methodologies, including Spikes, Epics, User Stories, daily standup meetings (in-class or via Slack), and visual board team organization (Trello). 
            I specifically worked on the backend portion of the site, using a model/view/controller paradigm to represent the customer/site administrator.  
        </p>

        <p>
            <u>Rush Hour - April 2023:</u> <br /> <br />
            Engineered a JavaFX-based simulation of the "Rush Hour" game in collaboration with a team of two, employing Visual Studio Code for development and Git/GitHub for 
            version control and repository management. Applied the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and event-driven programming logic to successfully program 
            and enhance the game's functionality.

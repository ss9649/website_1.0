            <h2>Welcome, you have landed on the information page!</h2>
            <p>Here I will try and answer some questions about the site design, the future of the site, and my next steps among other things.</p>

            <h2>Q: Why Internal Style Sheets?</h2>
            <p>A: I chose internal style sheets because I was having trouble importing the 'Poppins' font from Google Fonts directly into my external CSS file, so I decided to 
              include the fonts and also, conveniently, the rest of the styling in the same HTML file. I do recognize that this is frowned upon, and only proceeded with this 
              design choice due to the rather small size of this website.

            <h2>Q: Is this site mobile compatible?</h2>
            <p>A: I had designed the site with desktop monitor users in mind, so, unfortunately, this site does not look good on mobile screens.</p>

            <h2>Q: Will there be any further additions to this site?</h2>
            <p>A: I had this site in mind as just a personal advertising page and a first venture into the realm of web development. 
              So, this site in particular will probably not see any major changes other than information updates. I plan on launching
              another website, either in HTML, CSS, and Javascript or a full-stack website that could serve as a personal blog.
